## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- TailwiindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

i LEARNES THAT EXIST THE REACTHOOK FORM and as the context in react, also i can use a context on the form to avoid passing props everywhere.

### Continued development

I still need to keep practicing a lot
